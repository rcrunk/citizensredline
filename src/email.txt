Dear Congressperson,


The President has recently asked Congress for authorization to take military action against the government of Syria; the President has drawn a red line that he alleges was crossed by the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons. While following the U.S. rule of law seeking congressional authority for using military force is the proper thing to do, intervening in Syria is absolutely not.

There are many reasons why a military strike on Syria by the United States borders on insanity:

* An attack on Syria does not benefit or further U.S. interests.
* The federal government is already over $16 trillion in debt and any military action would only add to that enormous debt.
* A strike against Syria could very well be a precursor to conflict on a much larger scale.
* The U.S. has neither the authority nor the responsibility to be the Policeman of the World.
* Over 100,000 Syrians have died so far in this conflict, which encompasses both pro and anti government factions; a strike on Syria would only make a bad humanitarian crisis worse.
* The very terrorists that we have been fighting for many years are the ones that benefit the most by U.S. intervention in Syria.
* The U.S. will suffer irreparable harm to its interests and credibility if it is learned that the Syrian government were not behind these chemical attacks. Iraq is still fresh in the world's memory.

But, I expect that I am not telling you nothing that you don't already know. The question is: What are you going to do? Are you going to side with the bankers, the military/security complex,and AIPAC, or are you going to side with the interests of the American People? 

Choose carefully, because here is the red line I am drawing for you: If you vote for the U.S. to intervene in Syria, it is evident that you are neither deserving or qualified to hold public office, and I will use whatever legal means at my disposal to insure that this will be your last term.
