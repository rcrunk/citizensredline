    <h3>Accountability</h3>

    <p class="teaser">
      It was very recent that a U.S. President, his Secretary of State, and Congressional
      <em>leaders</em> lied Americans and Citizens throughout the world into a costly and
      needless war based on manipulation of largely fabricated intelligence. The Syria script
      smells a lot like an adaptation of the Iraq script, and, not surprisingly, involves many
      of the same actors.
    </p>

    <p class="teaser">
      The question avoided by the players and media lapdogs alike is the most obvious one:
      If the evil we are trying to remove from power remains in power, does that constitute a credible
      threat to the United States? The answer to that for Syria is exactly the same as it was for
      Libya and Iraq--and is and will be for Iran: No. There is no threat, immediate or otherwise.
      Therefore, <strong>NO</strong> is the only vote acceptable regarding whether to authorize
    military intervention in Syria.
      <a href="#" class="btn btn-xs more">More&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</a>
    </p>

    <p class="detail">
      The humanitarian argument is simply not credible coming from those who have killed, and continue
      to kill, innocents on a daily basis, dismissing them as collateral damage in a nebulous and
      astronomically expensive war on terror. Comparing the situations involving Bashar al-Assad
      and the Syrian civil war to Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany is an insult to the intelligence
      of any thinking individual and an affront to Citizens everywhere.
    </p>

    <p class="detail">
      The impending decision that Congress has before it, is whether or not to go to war.
      You can call it what you like: surgical strike, limited engagement, no boots on
      the ground, whatever; let there be no doubt, striking Syria with missiles when
      they have not attacked us or our allies, <strong>is</strong> an act of war, and
    an act Syria would be fully justified in defending itself against. What then?
    Retaliation? This could escalate very easily.
    </p>

    <p class="detail">
      This vote by Congress could very well be the spark that sets off World War III or, equally
      possible, an economic meltdown. Both of these outcomes are very real possibilities; the risk
      vs reward proposition regarding intervening in Syria is heavily in favor if it ending badly.
      <em>Therefore</em> we regard any members of congress who votes in favor of intervention in
      Syria as either foolhardy, or is placing other interests in front of the Citizens they serve.
      Both are sufficient cause for Citizens to use whatever legal means necessary to
      prevent their reelection where they would only do more mischief.
    </p>

    <p class="detail">
      We are, and will be keeping track of each vote for Syrian intervention made by
      congress so Citizens can hold them accountable for their mistake.

    <h3>Action</h3>

    <p class="teaser">
      We, as Citizens cannot allow this to continue to happen. A constant
      stream of military interventions does nothing to make us safer, stronger, or
      respected; if anything, it makes us less so. But what, as Citizens, can we do?
    </p>

    <p class="teaser">
      First, vote. Voter turnout was only a paltry 57.5% in the most recent
      national election. Citizens can and must represent themselves better to put
      corrupt politicians out of office. Placing a red line and watching who crosses
      it makes voting simple; vote for their opponent. No question, no debate;
      their political party does not factor into the equation and nothing
      else they have to say is relevant. By their deeds and actions, they have
      eliminated themselves from consideration for public office.
      <a href="#" class="btn btn-xs more">More&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</a>
    </p>

    <p class="detail">
      Reject partisan politics that are used to divide and confuse. Recognizing
      that political corruption permeates congress and the executive branch on both
      sides of the aisle, it is important to focus on what they do and not what they
      say and provide your support accordingly. It is not a Democrat vs Republic
      issue; it is an issue of the plunder of Citizens by those in power.
    </p>

    <p class="detail">
      Second, you can spread the word. Using social media and word of mouth, educate
      others about the vile slime who make decisions that are completely removed from
      sanity. You cannot count on the mainstream media to do it for you, as they are
      in on the charade, beating the drums of war against Syria just as they beat the
      drums of war against Iraq 10 years ago.
    </p>

    <p class="detail">
      Third, you can vote with your pocketbook. Do not provide financial support for
      those that would, and have, put the interests of the financiers, the military
      industrial complex, and AIPAC above those of American Citizens. That includes
      not only the line crossing politician, but the party he/she belongs to.
      If you feel compelled to donate politically, do so to individual candidates who
      are running against the ones who have crossed the red line, or to a third political
      party.
    </p>

    <p class="detail">
      Finally, reject the main stream media and their constant spin on events that
      bolster and reinforce the deception of our leaders. As the internet has fostered
      the birth and growth of alternative media, it is easier now than it has ever been
      to fact check the rhetoric and propaganda spewed forth by the media giants that
      aid and abet criminal conduct of politicians. Follow lapdog media only enough to
      identify the sponsors, and then boycott.

    <h3>Education</h3>

    <p class="teaser">
      It is difficult for many to discern fact from fiction when major media reports
      even the most bizarre utterances of proven liars as credible testimony, always
      challenging and discrediting those that question the official narrative
      and never the narrative itself. Recognition and awareness of this sleight of
      hand is often an epiphany for many; the point where one begins to see patterns
      repeat themselves across the corporate media landscape and the veracity of
      their words are revealed as the willful and premeditated deception they truly are.
    </p>

    <p class="teaser">
      Clearly, main stream media has been a lousy steward of the important role of
      holding government officials accountable for the mistakes they make and the lies
      they tell.
      This is evidenced by the obvious fact that several of the same players that were
      responsible for the disaster that was U.S. intervention in Iraq, still hold public
      office today, and are now pushing for intervention in Iraq.
      Thus, to educate oneself, it is necessary to question the narrative of the talking heads
      in politics and main stream media, and give due consideration to facts and opinions
      presented by those with opposing views.

      It is also necessary to know who represents you, how they vote on this and other matters
      of concern, and when they are up for reelection.
    </p>
    <ul class="detail">
      <li>
        The President is elected every 4 years; Barrack Obama cannot be reelected as he is in the 2nd
        term of a maximum 2 terms. The next presidential election is in 2016, so pay close
        attention to the words and deeds of politicians today so you can be prepared for tomorrow.
      </li>
      <li>
        The term for a Senator is 6 years and there are 2 per state. The next senatorial election
        is 2014 where the office comes up for renewal in 33 states. Citizens are eligible to
        vote only for the Senator that represents their state; a list of Senators by state can
        be found <a href="http://www.democratichub.com/senate-list.aspx">Here.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        The term for a member of the House of Representatives is 2 years; the number of representatives
        for each state varies based on its population, with a limit of 435 representatives total.
        Citizens are allowed to vote for the representative for the district of the state in which they
        live. Armed with your zip code, you can find your representative at
        <a href="http://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep?ZIP4">Find your Representative</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="detail">
      It is also important to know that there are alternatives beyond the two major political
      parties. A vote cast for a candidate of a third party is a clear signal by a Citizen that
      they will not abide by business as usual and wont tolerate the continued shenanigans engaged
      by politicians of the Democrat and Republican parties. The political parties that have sufficient
      ballot access to seriously contest the two party monopoly include:
    </p>
    <ul class="detail">
      <li>
        The Libertarian Party (<a href="http://www.lp.org" target="_blank">www.lp.org</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        The Green Party (<a href="http://www.gp.org" target="_blank">www.gp.org</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        The Constitution Party (<a href="http://www.constitutionparty.com"
                                   target="_blank">www.constitutionparty.com</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="detail">
      Please note that <strong>all three</strong> of the parties listed above are strongly against
    intervention in Syria.
